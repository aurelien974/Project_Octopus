# Project_Octopus

This is a little 2D game I made to discover Unity.

It is a 2 player versus game with asynchronous gameplay.
There is 2 rounds and the players switch roles after the first round. 

It is not finished yet, I would like to add :
- better graphics
- better HUD and menu
- add round X/2 in game state
- objects landing on the ground that can be taken by the 2 players to change the dynamism
